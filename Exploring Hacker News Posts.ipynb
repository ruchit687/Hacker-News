    "1. As per the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts\">*documentation*</a>, the timezone used is Eastern Time (US). So, we could use this: [15:00 >> 3:00 pm EST].\n",
    "2. The data set we analyzed excluded posts without any comments.\n",
    "3. Given that, it's more accurate to say that of the posts that received comments, ask posts received more comments on average and ask posts created between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm est - 4:00 pm est) received the most comments on average."
